A restaurant menu UI/UX project is the process of designing a menu that is both visually appealing and easy to use.
The goal of a good restaurant menu is to meake easy for customers to find the dishes they want, and to encourage them to order more.
The menu is categorised so that customers can easily find out the dishes they are looking out for.
The categories are clear and concise and they should be consistent throughout the menu.
